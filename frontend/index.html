<!-- WEB Evolution:
      1990s: first webs were born with HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).
            Webs were static documents (text, images, links). No colors, no logic, no interactivity.
            
      Mid-1990s: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and Javascript (added behaviour: animations, logic, clicks) came.
                Thanks to <div> and <script> in HTML.

      Modern web development:
                · Today modern websites still need HTML, but it's used only the essential part.
                · HTML is now mostly a small "container" where JavaScript builds and updates everything dinamically.
      
                Today:
                  > HTML = 🦴Skeleton : Structure & meaning of content
                  > CSS = 🎨Skin & clothes: Appearance
                  > JavaScript = 🧠Brain: Behavior & logic

      🌟 W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) organization defines web standards:
                  > HTML is the universal protocol for web's content.
                  > Every page, no matter if it's build with React, Angular, Python, or PHP, in the end,
                  turns into HTML before reaching your browser.
